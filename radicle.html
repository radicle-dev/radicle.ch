      <strong>Radicle</strong>

      <h3>Development of Radicle</h3>

      <p>The Foundation’s board coordinates some of Radicle’s project-wide strategy and
      objectives, allocating funds towards development that will positively impact
      the project.  While the Foundation supported the development and deployment of
      the Radicle Network, the Foundation does not own, manage, or control or act as
      an administrator of the Radicle Network - nor is it responsible for the ongoing
      operation, running, or functioning of the Radicle Network. The Radicle Network,
      accessible through various open interfaces, operates in a fully decentralized
      and autonomous manner – completely independent from the Foundation – and has an
      opt-in Ethereum protocol integration.</p>

      <p>The Radicle Foundation continues to support contributors to Radicle who develop
      the technical stack and support the growth of the Radicle community.</p>

      <h3>Accessing Radicle-Link</h3>

      <p>“Radicle-Link” is a secure, peer-to-peer protocol for code collaboration - and
      it’s open-sourced [link to Github]. The protocol extends the open source
      software Git with peer-to-peer network discovery, disseminating software code
      and Git data via a process called “gossip”.  Radicle-Link can be accessed
      without interacting with Radicle Smart Contracts. At the moment, there are two
      user interfaces for Radicle-Link: <a href="https://radicle.xyz/downloads.html">
      Upstream</a> and a <a href="https://app.radicle.network">web client</a>.

      <h3>Accessing Radicle Smart Contracts</h3>

      <p>Radicle is integrated with Ethereum via its own set of smart contracts, which
      are used to create and manage identities (ENS names, in particular) as well as
      organizations (“Orgs”) within the Radicle Network. There are various ways to
      interact with Radicle’s Ethereum integration, such as those interfaces and
      access points linked here.</p>
